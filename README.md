First SQL project focused on data cleaning, where I applied various techniques to ensure data accuracy, consistency, and reliability. This project involved:

Data Import and Integration: Loaded and integrated data from multiple sources into a unified database.

Error Detection and Correction: Identified and corrected errors such as duplicate records, missing values, and incorrect data entries.

Data Transformation: Standardized data formats, converted data types, and implemented normalization techniques to optimize database performance.

Data Validation: Ensured data quality through rigorous validation rules and integrity constraints.

Documentation: Maintained comprehensive documentation of the cleaning process to ensure reproducibility and transparency.
